Axon tool download/edit/push etc ...
editor :
1) basic parsing, check variables and methods exit
2) check methods params match context (is there such a thing)
1B) Or call real axon parser / compiler on save and highlight errors
check tags used exits (haystack)

-> Do this for axon first

ScanForUsingsAndTypes -> gives me available types

set scope per document index ie : [char 128 to char 242] ?
or rather glue them to proper type def (global, class, slot, closure)

quick scan:
- each class -> if inheritance, fetch inherited types from index and had to scope
 - each fields -> :=  store the type for each field (no inference needed on fields), warn if errors, add to scope
 - each slot ->
    -check params types are know and add to scope
    - each closure -> check params types and add to scope
    - local local type defs(assignment) -> juts store var name but no inference yet

whole document check for assignment (=) that we know that variable (in scope)
warn of overriding (same var already assigned in scope)

show errors/warning in editor (wayvy lines with tooltip?)
